# FreeYourPages

An app to export documents to other apps from apps that don't allow you to.

Using action extensions, FreeYourPages adds an action to share sheets for services that simply share links to their documents hosted on their own site,
instead of sharing the actual content.

## Contribute 

I started writing this having very little experience with iOS programming and even less experience with Swift.
This project has served as a learning exercise.
Therefore, the code is likely to be very bad and in need of much improvement.

If you would like to contribute, feel free to do so via pull request. 

**I am especially looking for people who are good at UI/Graphic design to contribute to the following**

* General user interface of the main application
* Interface of the Action extension
* Graphics for the main application icon, the action extension icon, and the splash screen

## FAQs

**Will you put this on the App Store?**

Currently, I have few plans to do this due to lack of a paid Apple developer account.
I would either have to make the app prohibitedly expensive to recoup the costs, or this would have
to be donated to me. If this is something you're interested in doing, please let me know at
[nat@nath.is](mailto:nat@nath.is?subject=FreeYourPages Developer Donation)

**Does this work with protected Scribd documents?**

No, and I currently have no plans to make it do so due to how the application works. If you have any neat ideas, feel free to [Contribute](#contribute)

**How does *FreeYourPages* work?**

Currently, it simply pretends to be a user on the [Scribd](http://scribd.com) website and uses their PDF download tool that they decided
to make available on the website but not within the app.

**Will you be adding more services?**

I may at some point of my own accord add more services to FreeYourPages.
However, I created this app because I use Scribd myself and it was frustrating me that there was no real way to export Scribd documents
to Google Drive within the iOS app, and I currently have no other need for this app.
If there is a service you would like me to add, feel free to suggest it via the Issues tab.
